GitHub Learning Lab
- Special Files:
  - README.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md: used to describe the process for contributing to the repository
    - link to this file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request
  - ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue
    - Issue: suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be labeled and assigned to a user.
1. Assign Yourself
- Issues > Assignees
2. Turn on GitHub Pages
3. Close the Issue
4. Create a Branch
- Branch: test
5. Commit a File
- The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.
- Rules:
  - Don’t end your commit message with a period.
  - Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.
  - Use active voice. For example, "add" instead of "added" and "merge" instead of "merged".
  - Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.
6. Open a Pull Request
- Pull requests help you share your changes, receive feedback on them, and iterate on them until they’re perfect!
- This pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the master branch.
